GitHub.
--------
 GitHub is one of the most popular resources for developers to share code and work on projects together. It is free,
 easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software. GitHub is an online software
 development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to
 upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as
 a social networking site in which developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work. GitHub allows
 software developers and engineers to create remote, public-facing repositories on the cloud for free. Once you’ve set
 up a repository on GitHub, we can copy it to your device, add and modify files locally, then “push” your changes back
 to the repository where our changes are displayed to the public.
